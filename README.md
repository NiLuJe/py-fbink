# Python cFFI bindings for FBInk

Licensed under the [AGPLv3](/LICENSE).

See [FBInk](https://github.com/NiLuJe/FBInk) ;).

# Usage

See the basic [example](/hello.py), it's basically [Python](https://www.python.org/) + [cffi](https://cffi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using.html) + [FBInk](https://github.com/NiLuJe/FBInk/blob/master/fbink.h) ;).
There's absolutely zero higher-level wrapping, so you can pretty much follow FBInk's C API.

Because cross-compiling Python & Python modules is fairly hellish, this is bundled with my usual Python packages ([Kindle](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=225030) & [Kobo](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=254214)) ;).
